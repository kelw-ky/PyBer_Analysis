## Summary
From this data, we could see the different total fares between the three different city tyes. The average fares for rides and drivers are significantly lower in Urban areas compared with Rural and Suburban. It would make sense to increase the total fares, whether the distance rates or the base amount. Focus more growth in Rural areas, as there less riders and driver. more advertisements and discount to attract in more riders. Lastly, I would reduce the number of total drivers as there are less rides than drivers. This would also allow the Average Fare per driver to increase.
